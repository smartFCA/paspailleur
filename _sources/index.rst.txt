.. rubric:: Remember the name

Package name `Paspailleur` is pronounced as [pas.pa.j≈ì Å] that can be simplified to [paspajor] or [paspayor].
The name comes from the french word "Orpailleur" meaning "gold miner".
Orpailleur was also the name of the team where the package's development was initiated.
So, in a sense, `Paspailleur` can be deciphered as "Pattern Structures miner".


.. rubric:: Useful links

GALACTIC software (https://galactic.univ-lr.fr): a Python package for working with Pattern Structures developed in La Rochelle Universit√©.
It is also a part of SmartFCA project.

.. rubric:: Funding

The package development is supported by ANR project SmartFCA (ANR-21-CE23-0023).

SmartFCA (https://www.smartfca.org/) is a big platform that will contain many extensions of Formal Concept Analysis including pattern structures, Relational Concept Analysis, Graph-FCA and others. While caspailleur is a small python package that covers only the basic notions of FCA.
