.. rubric:: Remember the name

Package name `Paspailleur` is pronounced as [pas.pa.jœʁ] that can be simplified to [paspajor] or [paspayor].
The name comes from the french word "Orpailleur" meaning "gold miner".
Orpailleur was also the name of the team where the package's development was initiated.
So, in a sense, `Paspailleur` can be deciphered as "Pattern Structures miner".
